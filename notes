Goal: 
  - build a data visualizaiton ui designed for the iPad.
  - keep it minimalistic and refine refine refine
  - use uncommon attention to detail
  - simplicity with emergent properties 
  - "Simple rules lead to complex behavior. Complex rules lead to stupid behavior"
  - Layer the complexity

walkthrough:
  - user loads data (csv)
  - evaluation of data
    - what are the dimensions and metrics?
    - what is the rollup?
  - process the data
  - present the data
    - inital presentation is force directed bubbles (representing raw data)
    - user can compose visualizations on top of the data
    - user scrolls left/right to pivot dimensions
    - user scrolls down/up to drill in/out of data
  - that's it!

progression:
  - A
    - load hard-coded csv
    - determine structure and build data engine google "javascript database library"
    - present bubbles
  - B: composability
    - build more components
        - layout components
    - drag & drop: https://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/9669633
  - C
    -introduce data restructuring
      - user can change the rollup
      - dynamically happens with pivots?
  - D
    - add scrolling https://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/8411383
    - introduce file loading
